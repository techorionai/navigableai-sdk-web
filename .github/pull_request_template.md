**Checklist**

- [ ] **Version bump check**: Version has been updated in `package.json` if this is a release
- [ ] **README version check**: README.md has the correct updated version in CDN URLs (lines 27 & 34)
- [ ] **Version consistency**: Version in `package.json` matches version referenced in README.md
